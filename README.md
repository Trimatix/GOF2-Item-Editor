# GOF2-Item-Editor
Galaxy on Fire 2 by DeepSilver FishLabs stores its game items in a proprietary database, encoded as a binary file.

SkaterFromHell of 4pda.to wrote a python script to parse and edit these item configuration files, found here: https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=483666&view=findpost&p=88289467

This repository wraps the script into a tkinter application with a basic "GUI" - a CLI in a graphical window, to allow users without python installed on their system.
